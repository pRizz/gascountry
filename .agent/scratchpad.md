### Verification

---

## Step 1 - COMPLETED

### Changes Made
- [x] Created `/frontend` directory and moved all React code into it
- [x] Created `/backend` directory with Rust project scaffold
- [x] Created workspace `Cargo.toml` at root with `members = ["backend"]`
- [x] Frontend paths already use relative references - no changes needed
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` for Rust artifacts (target/, Cargo.lock)
- [x] Created `backend/src/main.rs` with minimal Axum server and health endpoint

### Directory Structure
```
ralphtown/
├── Cargo.toml              # Workspace manifest
├── frontend/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── vite.config.ts
│   ├── src/
│   └── ...
├── backend/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/main.rs
└── README.md
```

### Verification
- Frontend build: ✅ PASS (`npm run build` from frontend/)
- Frontend tests: ✅ PASS (1/1)
- Backend check: ✅ PASS (`cargo check` from root)

---

## Next: Step 2 - Backend Scaffold with Axum

Step 2 is partially complete since we already have:
- Axum server with health check endpoint
- CORS configuration
- Basic logging with tracing

Remaining tasks for Step 2:
- [ ] Add basic error handling types
- [ ] Test that server starts and health endpoint returns 200

---

## Notes
- Lint has pre-existing errors in shadcn-ui components (not from rename)
- Tests pass (1/1)
- Backend uses Axum 0.8, tower-http 0.6
